    "Benford's Law asserts that the distribution of **the leading digit** in many of our daily-life data obey a particular distribution that is **non-uniform**. This interesting finding becomes a super handy tool in many fields such as **forensic accounting**. (If you are interested, read this 2010 article https://www.gettrymarcus.com/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/MW-Applying-Benfords-Law-in-Financial-Forensic-Investigations.pdf.)\n",
